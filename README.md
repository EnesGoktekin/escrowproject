Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Node.js (>= 16.x)

Rust & Cargo (for smart contract development)

MultiversX CLI

Metamask or xPortal Wallet

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/EnesGoktekin/escrowproject.git
cd escrowproject

2. Set Up Backend (Smart Contract)

cd backend
cargo build
cargo test  # Run tests

3. Deploy Smart Contract

mxpy contract deploy --project backend --recall-nonce --gas-limit=5000000 --pem=wallet.pem --proxy=https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com

Replace wallet.pem with your actual wallet private key.

4. Set Up Frontend

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # Start local development server

Then, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Environment Variables

Create a .env file inside the frontend folder with the following:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourSmartContractAddress
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://your-blockchain-rpc

Usage

Connect your wallet using xPortal or Metamask.

Initiate a transaction by placing funds in escrow.

The smart contract holds the funds until conditions are met.

Upon agreement, funds are released securely.
